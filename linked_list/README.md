# Linked List

## Sample.java
- test code

## deleteDups
- a method that removes duplicate elements from an unsorted linked list.

## findLastNth
- a method that find the kth element from the tail in the singly-linked list.

## deleteNode
- In singly-linked list, suppose that you connot access the head and tail of list, and only can access a node to be deleted. Imprement a method to remove it.

## listAdder
- There are two linked lists in which the elements of each node are one digit number and one's digit is the head. Then, implement a method to obtains the sum of two lists and to express it as a linked list.

## is Palindrome
- a method to determine if a given linked list is a palindrome.

## isBranch
- When two singly-linked list are given, implement a method to determine whether two lists have a common node and to return the node. Not elements but node itself.

## findRing
- a method that returns the first node of a circular part when a circular linked list is given.
